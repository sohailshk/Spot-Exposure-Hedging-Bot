     ↓              ↓               ↓              ↓
  Real-time    Greeks & Risk    Hedge Signals   User Alerts
   Prices       Metrics        & Execution     & Controls
```

### 3. Key Design Patterns

- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable hedging strategies
- **Observer Pattern**: Real-time risk monitoring
- **Factory Pattern**: Configuration and object creation
- **Async/Await**: Non-blocking operations for real-time performance

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Risk Calculation Engine

The system implements the Black-Scholes model for options pricing and Greeks calculation:

**Black-Scholes Formula Implementation:**
```python
def black_scholes_call(S, K, T, r, sigma):
    d1 = (np.log(S/K) + (r + 0.5*sigma**2)*T) / (sigma*np.sqrt(T))
    d2 = d1 - sigma*np.sqrt(T)
    call_price = S*norm.cdf(d1) - K*np.exp(-r*T)*norm.cdf(d2)
    return call_price
```

**Greeks Calculation:**
- **Delta**: First derivative with respect to underlying price
- **Gamma**: Second derivative with respect to underlying price  
- **Theta**: Time decay
- **Vega**: Sensitivity to volatility changes
- **Rho**: Sensitivity to interest rate changes

### 2. Hedging Strategies

#### Delta-Neutral Strategy
Maintains portfolio delta close to zero by adjusting hedge ratios:
```python
def calculate_hedge_ratio(self, portfolio):
    total_delta = sum(pos.delta * pos.size for pos in portfolio.positions)
    return -total_delta / portfolio.get_total_exposure()
```

#### Protective Put Strategy
Implements downside protection using put options:
- Strike selection based on desired protection level
- Cost-benefit analysis for different strike prices
- Dynamic adjustment based on market conditions

#### Collar Strategy
Combines protective puts with covered calls:
- Reduces hedging cost through premium collection
- Caps upside potential while protecting downside
- Optimizes strike selection for risk/return profile

### 3. Real-time Monitoring System

The Telegram bot provides:
- **Live Risk Alerts**: Automatic notifications when thresholds are breached
- **Interactive Commands**: Portfolio management through chat interface
- **Real-time Updates**: Live market data and risk metrics
- **Multi-user Support**: Isolated portfolios per user

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Test Coverage
- **64 Total Tests**: Comprehensive coverage across all components
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component functionality
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow validation
- **Async Tests**: Real-time operation validation

### Testing Framework
```python
# Example test structure
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_risk_monitoring():
    bot = TelegramBot(config)
    await bot.monitor_position("AAPL", 1000, 0.1)
    assert bot.monitoring_tasks["user_123_AAPL"] is not None
```

### Quality Metrics
- ✅ **100% Test Pass Rate**: All 64 tests passing
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for missing dependencies
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Type hints throughout codebase
- ✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings and comments

## Configuration Management

### Hierarchical Configuration
```yaml
# config.yaml structure
market_data:
  default_provider: "yfinance,binance"
  fallback_provider: ""
  
risk:
  delta_threshold: 0.1
  gamma_threshold: 0.05
  
telegram:
  bot_token: "${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}"
  rate_limit_requests: 10
```

## Performance & Scalability
